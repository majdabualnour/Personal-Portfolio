            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="about-text">
                <p>At just 18 years old, I'm Majd Adel Abualnour - a self-taught programmer, AI enthusiast, and tech entrepreneur from Gaza. With over 6 years of experience in artificial intelligence and microcontroller programming, I've turned my passion for technology into powerful solutions that make a real difference.</p>
                
                <p>Growing up in a challenging environment, I discovered early on that technology could be my gateway to a world of possibilities. What started as a curious teenager tinkering with code has blossomed into founding <strong>Magic Tech MT</strong>, where we've developed innovative solutions impacting over 200,000 people in my community. Our work with organizations like World Central Kitchen and the World Food Programme has revolutionized aid distribution systems, increasing efficiency by nine times.</p>
                
                <p>My journey hasn't been without obstacles, but each challenge has only fueled my determination. From winning national competitions and earning a trip to NASA, to publishing my book on Computer Vision and creating the <strong>Dashxslash</strong> platform that provides free education to students worldwide, I've learned that perseverance and innovation can overcome even the most difficult circumstances.</p>
                
                <p>Today, I'm not just a programmer - I'm a mentor to 150+ aspiring developers, a published author, and a firm believer in the power of technology to create positive change. My work in AI and IoT has earned international recognition, but my true passion lies in using these skills to empower others and build a better future for my community.</p>

His ability to create such advanced systems at his age is truly exceptional. For example, while working with World Central Kitchen (WCK) and the World Food Programme (WFP), he developed a system to arrange aid distribution that can handle over 1,000 requests daily—something I would never have believed possible at such a young age. His work, especially in AI and microcontroller programming, is nothing short of remarkable."</blockquote>

We first met during the Science and IT club at Al-Qattan foundation in Gaza City, and since then, we’ve worked closely on Scientific and Technological projects. Our most significant collaboration was during September and October of 2024, where I observed their exceptional qualities like leadership, problem-solving, and teamwork through an educational community-based initiative which Majd invited me to join him in. Through these experiences and the ones before, I have had the luck of seeing Majd's growth, dedication, and passion for transforming lives using his passion for computer science."</blockquote>
